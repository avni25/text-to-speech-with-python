At each node along the signal path, we determine an quivalent resistance to small-signal ground and an equivalent capacitance to small-signal ground. The resulting RC network gives rise to a high-frequency pole.",

"Graph problems pervade computer science, and algorithms for working with them are fundamental to the field. Hundreds of interesting computational problems are couched in terms of graphs. In this part, we touch on a few of the more significant ones. Chapter 22 shows how we can represent a graph in a computer and then discusses algorithms based on searching a graph using either breadth-first search or depthfirst search. The chapter gives two applications of depth-first search: topologically sorting a directed acyclic graph and decomposing a directed graph into its strongly connected components."]
